#****h* Cygclasses/waf.cygclass
#  SYNOPSIS
#  inherit waf
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Waf is a general-purpose build system written in Python used by XMMS2, a
#  few GTK+ programs, and some other projects.  The build system is provided
#  by a bundled 'waf' script in the top source directory, and is driven
#  by a 'wscript' file in the top source directory and 'wscript_build' files
#  in subdirectories, both of which are also written in Python.
#  NOTE
#  Previous versions uses to allow use of a system installed waf.  This is no
#  longer supported, as waf does not have a stable API and is therefore not
#  feasibly used in this way.  Fortunately, by now most packages do include
#  a recent enough waf to build properly with at most only patches to 'wscript'
#  and/or 'wscript_build' files.
#  REQUIRES
#  python
#****

# cross-compiling is not (yet?) supported
__cross_compiling_error

#****C* waf.cygclass/waf_compile
#  SYNOPSIS
#  waf_compile [OPTIONS]
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Runs 'waf configure' to configure the package, followed by 'waf build' to
#  compile it.  WAF_CONFIGURE_FLAGS and WAF_BUILD_FLAGS can be defined to pass
#  additional arguments to the configure and build commands, respectively.
#  Any arguments to waf_compile are passed as configure flags to the 'waf
#  configure' command.  waf_compile must be run from the directory containing
#  'wscript'.

#****v* waf_compile/WAF_CONFIGURE_FLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  String containing additional arguments to pass to 'waf configure'.

#****v* waf_compile/WAF_BUILD_FLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  String containing additional arguments to pass to 'waf build'.
#****
	${WAF} build ${WAF_BUILD_FLAGS} || error "waf build failed"
}

#****T* waf.cygclass/waf_test
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Runs the package's test suite with 'waf check'.  WAF_TEST_FLAGS can be
#  defined to pass additional arguments to the check command.  Any arguments
#  to waf_test are passed as well. waf_test must be run from the directory
#  containing 'wscript'.

#  DESCRIPTION
#  String containing additional arguments to pass to 'waf check'.

#****I* waf.cygclass/waf_install
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Installs the package into $D with 'waf install'.  WAF_INSTALL_FLAGS can be
#  defined to pass additional arguments to the install command.  Any arguments
#  to waf_install are passed as well. waf_install must be run from the directory
