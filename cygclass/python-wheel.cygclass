#****h* Cygclasses/python-wheel.cygclass
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Wheels are the new standard for installing Python libraries and programs.
#  The build is defined by a setup.py file in the top source directory, which
#  controls the installation of files and the building of C Python extensions.
#  Many such packages are hosted on the Python Package Index (PyPI).
#
#  This cygclass handles the building of wheel-based Python module packages
#  for multiple Python versions simultaneously.
#  EXAMPLE
#    inherit python-wheel
#    
#    NAME="python-six"
#    VERSION=1.10.0
#    RELEASE=1
#    CATEGORY="Python"
#    SUMMARY="Python 2 and 3 compatibility library"
#    DESCRIPTION="Six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library. It provides
#    utility functions for smoothing over the differences between the Python
#    versions with the goal of writing Python code that is compatible on both
#    Python versions."
#    
#    ARCH=noarch
#  INHERITS
#  python.org.cygclass
#  REQUIRES
#  pythonXY, pythonXY-pip (for each X.Y version of Python being built)

#****v* python-wheel.cygclass/PYTHON_WHEEL_VERSIONS
#  SYNOPSIS
#  PYTHON_WHEEL_VERSIONS="2.7:3.5" # e.g. added to stdlib in 3.6
#  inherit python-wheel
#  DESCRIPTION
#  A colon-seperated list of version(s) for which this module should be built.
#  Some aliases are also accepted:
#  * all: all supported versions (currently: 2.7, and 3.5 through 3.8)
#  * future: the default and upcoming versions (currently: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7)
#  * default: the default versions (currently: 2.7 and 3.6)
#  * 2: the default 2.x version (currently: 2.7)
#  * 3: the default 3.x version (currently: 3.6)
#  This variable must be defined before inheriting python-wheel.cygclass.
#  If undefined, "default" is assumed.
#  NOTES
#  * It is not generally expected for wheel packages to be built with "all".
#    This option is primarily intended for the most basic modules used to
#    build, install, and run other modules (e.g. setuptools, wheel, pip, and
#    virtualenv).  The "default" value is sufficient for most packages.
#  * The value "future" is intended to allow maintainers to get a head start on
#    rebuilding for the new version, but the maintainer must first assure that
#    the module works correctly on the new version and that either there are
#    no module dependencies outside of the standard library, or that they too
#    are already available.
#****

# when the default versions of Python change, this and the ENSUREPIP_OPTIONS
# switches need to be updated accordingly

#  Each package also includes its own independent copy of the automatically
#  installed documentation (COPYING, README, etc.).  For those packages which
#  install scripts into /usr/bin, these should be added to the respective
#  pythonXY_foo_CONTENTS.
