This is cygport, a revolutionary new method for building and maintaining
packages for the Cygwin distribution[1].


1. BACKGROUND

In the past, the sanctioned way of building a Cygwin package was by
using a build script, the template for which is commonly known as the
generic-build-script, or g-b-s[2].

However, the g-b-s has many drawbacks:

1) Even the simplest changes, such as adding an argument to configure,
   requires wading through the entire 500+ line script; many beginners 
   have struggled with their first packages.
   
2) Having a history as a ash script, it is nearly impossible to read, with
   run-on commands, && continuations, and backslash-escaped line breaks.

3) It is aimed primarily at autotooled packages, and adapting it to
   other packaging systems (e.g. perl MakeMaker, python Distutils,
   stand-alone Makefiles, etc.) requires having several "branches" of the
   script for each purpose.
   
4) Updating to a newer script requires either merging package-specific
   changes into a new template (and not forgetting anything), or
   back-porting g-b-s changes into an existing package script.
   
5) There is no simple method of dealing with an original source package
   whose name or top directory do not conform with the PKGNAME-VERSION
   form, or where the Cygwin package name differs from the upstream name
   (e.g. gtk2-x11 from gtk+).
   
6) It is not designed to create more than one binary package per source
   package -- e.g.  whereby the foo source is separated into foo, libfoo1,
   and libfoo-devel binary packages -- despite the fact that is often
   desirable to do so.

Having used the g-b-s in various forms for a couple of years, during
which I've packaged hundreds of unique source packages (not counting
versions), I have found various ways of 'getting by'.  I forked the
g-b-s a while back, and created a few templates for various purposes. 
This solution, however, is still severely limiting, as mentioned above.

In the meantime, I also had exposure to a Linux distribution and its
packaging system, namely Gentoo Linux and Portage.  Being a source-based
distribution, the entire packaging database consists of a collection of
scripts (ebuilds), which contain basic information about the package,
and the steps necessary to compile and install (into a DESTDIR) the
package.  With the repository available through WebCVS, it is indeed an
invaluable resource to anyone building a non-trivial package from
scratch.

In fact, Portage answers many of the drawbacks of the g-b-s:

1) Ebuilds are small, containing only package-specific information,
   making them easy to read, and even to create with little effort.

2) Ebuilds are written in a clean bash syntax.

3) The Eclass system allows ebuilds to be easily extended to any number
   of different build systems (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.) and/or categorical
   templates (e.g. GNOME or KDE).
   
4) Updates to Portage take affect immediately, without updating all
   ebuilds, and ebuilds can be created without even looking at the
   internals of Portage itself.
   
5) Ebuilds anyway define the source package name, and can easily
   override the assumed source top directory when necessary.

Despite it's advantages, implementing Portage on Cygwin is impractical,
because:

1) Portage is primarily a package management system, while Cygwin
   already uses setup.exe, and is impractical to use just for building
   packages.

2) Portage is mainly Linux/BSD specific in a number of ways which would
   not work for Cygwin, based on its Win32 limitations (such as replacing
   in-use files).

3) There is no way to create multiple binary packages from a single
   source package, without building the source multiple times.
   
4) Most importantly, setup.exe provides a GUI which makes installation
   easier for the uninitiated.

(It should be noted that there have been renewed attempts to run Portage 
on Cygwin[3], and this was even recently ITP'd and rejected[4].)


2. CONCEPT

The conclusion, therefore, was that a compromise was required: take the
g-b-s, and separate the package-specific (Ebuild) and
package-independent (Portage) sections into two parts.  The
package-independent sections would become the build system, into which
the package-specific information would be fed to create a package.  The
package-independent system could then be cleaned up and expanded without
affecting package-specific information.

From this idea, cygport was created.

The cygport build system contains all the package-independent functions
of the g-b-s, rewritten in a modern, easy-to-read bash syntax.  It
provides commonly-used build-time functions for the package .cygport
files, which contain only the compiling, testing, and installation
instructions.

In addition, cygport includes a two-fold modularization:

1) Many helper functions have been separated into their own scripts
   located in their own directory, making both them and the main cygport
   script easier to maintain.
   
2) Support for various build systems is provided through separate
   cygclasses, which are 'inherit'ed by the package .cygport as necessary.
   
The public functions and syntax (those used by a package .cygport) are
closer to those of Portage then of the g-b-s (it is extremely unlikely,
however, that a Gentoo ebuild will work as a .cygport with a simple
rename); internal syntax is still, to some degree, similar to the g-b-s.


3. USAGE

Similar to a g-b-s source package, a cygport-generated -src tarball will
contain the package .cygport, one or two patchfiles, and the original source
package, for example:

    foo-2.3.7.tar.gz
    foo2-2.3.7-1.cygport
    foo2-2.3.7-1.cygwin.patch
    foo2-2.3.7-1.src.patch     (will be absent if package builds OOTB)

GPG .sig files for any of the above may be present as well.  All these
files must remain in the same directory.

The general format of a cygport command is:

    cygport [/path/to/]PKGNAME-VERSION-RELEASE[.cygport] COMMAND [COMMAND2]
    
The first argument to cygport may be either a path to a .cygport file, e.g.:

    $ cygport /usr/src/foo2-2.3.7-1.cygport COMMAND
    
Or, alternatively, if cygport is run from the directory containing the
.cygport file, then the PKGNAME-VERSION-RELEASE triplet may be used
instead of a path:

    $ cd /usr/src
    $ cygport foo2-2.3.7-1 COMMAND

All other arguments are interpreted as a COMMAND, which may be:

    prep      - create working directory, unpack the source and apply patches
    compile   - run all compilation steps
    install   - install into a DESTDIR, and run post-installation steps
    package   - create binary and source packages
    finish    - delete the working directory
    all       - run all of the above, including finish
    almostall - run all of the above, except for finish

Other COMMANDs are meant primarily for maintainers:

    fetch    - download the original source from the Internet
    check    - run the testsuite
    postinst - re-run post-installation steps
    list     - create a file listing suitable for the Cygwin README
    deps     - list direct dependencies of all executables

The standard arguments --help or --version may also be passed to cygport.


4. CREATING A CYGPORT PACKAGE

See the data/sample.cygport file, included in the Cygwin package in
${prefix}/share/cygport, for an example.

The .cygport file name must be in the form PKGNAME-VERSION-RELEASE.cygport, 
where PKGNAME is the Cygwin package name (which need not be the same as 
the original source package name).

Pure bash syntax is used.  Since a .cygport file is itself not a
functioning script, the she-bang header (#!/bin/bash) should be omitted.

Bash-style comments may be included, beginning with # until end-of-line;
all comments are ignored during execution of cygport.

At a minimum, the following must be considered:

SRC_URI must be defined to a wget-downloadable URL; this is also used to
determine the original source package and assume its top directory name;
if the latter does not conform to PKGNAME-VERSION (in cygport syntax,
${PN}-${PV}, or ${P}), then define SRC_DIR.

There are certain cases where building within a managed mount is required, 
namely where the source package:

    * contains illegal Windows filenames;
    * contains filenames in the same directory with the same name but 
      different capitalizations (one of which will be overwritten if 
      unpacked normally),
    * contains headers with same name but different capitalization with
      system headers which are also used.

In these cases, a managed mount may be used automatically by defining 
USE_MANAGED_MOUNT.

During the src_* functions, be sure to cd into the correct directory. 
The directories are defined by cygport as follows:

    S is the original source directory; you should NOT compile here.
    B is the build directory, where all compilation should take place.
    D is the installation directory (DESTDIR).
    C is the CYGWIN-PATCHES directory.

All compilation is handled in the src_compile() function.

All autotool-based packages should have autoreconf run on them before
running configure, in order to pull in the current Cygwin libtool, and
to assure that patches to configure.in or Makefile.am actually take
affect.  The defaults are autoconf-2.5 and automake-1.9; these may be
overridden by defining WANT_AUTOCONF and WANT_AUTOMAKE to the desired
versions; be sure to remember that libtool-1.5 requires that
autoconf-2.5 be used.  The 'cygautoreconf' command handles all this for
you, and must be called at the beginning of the src_compile step. 
(Files regenerated through this process will be ignored when generating
the source patch.)

The 'cygconf' command should be run from ${B}, and it passes the
following arguments to configure:

    --prefix=/usr
    --exec-prefix=/usr
    --libexecdir=/usr/sbin
    --sysconfdir=/etc
    --localstatedir=/var

    (autoconf-2.13 or 2.5x)          (autoconf-2.60)
    --datadir=/usr/share             --datarootdir=/usr/share
    --infodir=/usr/share/info        --docdir=/usr/share/doc/${P}
    --mandir=/usr/share/man


These arguments will install everything according to the Cygwin
packaging guidelines. Additional arguments can be passed to configure as
arguments of cygconf, e.g.:

    cygconf --disable-static

or by defining CYGCONF_ARGS:

    CYGCONF_ARGS="--disable-static"

Remember that, in case of conflicting arguments, that configure will
accept only the last. Arguments to cygconf will override the default
arguments.

The 'cygmake' command calls make(1) and passes it ${MAKEOPTS} and any
arguments it receives. By default, MAKEOPTS is defined to '-j2' --
despite what it says on the Cygwin website[5], parallel make works just
as well on Cygwin as it does on Linux.  Some packages, however, use make
rules that break parallel jobs, in which case you can do one of the
following:

    MAKEOPTS+=" -j1"

    cygmake -j1

A default src_compile() is provided, which does the following:

    cd ${S}
    cygautoreconf
    cd ${B}
    cygconf
    cygmake

Another command that may come in useful is 'lndirs', which mirrors ${S}
into ${B} with symlinks.  This is primarily for use with non-autotooled 
packages, so that they may be built in ${B} rather than ${S}.

The src_test() function defines how to run the package testsuite, if
any, during the check command The default is to run 'make check' if the
package is autotool-based, otherwise 'make test' is run.  If a package
does not conform to this rule, then a src_test() function should be
included in the package .cygport.  For example:

    src_test() {
        cd ${B}
        make megatest
    }
    
If a package has no testsuite and will not accept a 'make test', then
define an empty src_test():
    
    src_test() {
        :
    }

The src_install() function defines how the package is installed into
${D}, from which various generic post-installation steps occur and the
binary package(s) are made.

The 'cyginstall' command runs 'make install'.  cyginstall can be run in
two modes.  If USE_DESTDIR=1 (the default), then DESTDIR=${D} is
defined, otherwise, if USE_DESTDIR=0, then prefix and all the standard
*dir values are redefined with a preceding ${D}; the latter is meant for
non-automake Makefiles which don't support DESTDIR.  In either mode,
cyginstall passes along any arguments it receives.

A number of helper commands are available for manually installing files
to various locations.  These commands have names and syntax almost
identical to their Gentoo counterparts.  When specifying directories,
write as if your installing to the system; the scripts will do
everything under ${D} for you.  Some examples:

    # create directories
    dodir /usr/share/foo/bar /usr/share/foo/misc

    # install -m755 into ${D}/usr/bin
    dobin foo.exe

    # install -m644 into a custom directory
    insinto /usr/include/foo-1.0
    doins ${S}/src/foo.h

    # install -m644 into ${D}/usr/lib
    dolib libfoo.dll.a    

The default src_install() is defined simply as:

    cd ${B}
    cyginstall

Many cygclasses also define default src_compile(), src_test(), and
src_install() functions, which will override the aforementioned defaults.

The post-install stage is run automatically after src_install(), during
which a number of steps are run:
    1) standard documentation is installed;
    2) postinstall and preremove scripts are created, if necessary;
    3) binaries are stripped;
    4) man pages are compressed.

A Cygwin README file should be included in the CYGWIN-PATCHES directory,
named README.  A standard template for this purpose is available from
the Cygwin distribution website[2].  The setup.hint files should also be
included in CYGWIN-PATCHES.
    
Most standard documentation files will be installed automatically; if
your package has a unique doc, then you can either pass them to 'dodoc'
during src_install(), or define DOCS as a string containing the names of
docs you want installed.

Many common postinstall/preremove script tasks are provided
automatically, including:

    1) GTK+ icon caching (gtk-update-icon-cache);
    2) GConf schemas (gconftool-2 --(un)install-makefile-rule);
    3) GNOME Yelp documentation (scrollkeeper-update);
    4) FreeDesktop.org Desktop Menu files (update-desktop-database);
    5) FreeDesktop.org Shared Mime Info files (update-mime-database);

Custom postinstall and preremove commands may be included in the
CYGWIN-PATCHES directory as postinstall.sh and preremove.sh; these
scripts should be written as stubs, without the she-bang header.


5. PACKAGING

In most cases, only one binary package is created from a source package,
including all files installed into ${D}.  This is the default, and if
this applies to your package, the rest of this section is irrelevant.

However, there are many cases -- often with library packages -- that it
is desirable to create multiple binary packages from one source. 
cygport makes that very easy.

Let's take a typical GNOME 2 library package as an example.  Such
packages contain runtime libraries and data, development headers and
libraries, and API documentation.  In order to create separate binary
packages for each of these, all that is necessary is to define a few
variables:

    PKG_NAMES="${PN} ${PN}-devel ${PN}-doc"
    PKG_HINTS="setup devel doc"
    PKG_CONTENTS[0]="etc/ usr/bin/ usr/lib/bonobo/ usr/share/doc/ \
        usr/share/man/"
    PKG_CONTENTS[1]='usr/include/ usr/lib/lib* usr/lib/pkgconfig/'
    PKG_CONTENTS[2]='usr/share/gtk-doc/'

Or an ordinary library package may look like:

    PKG_NAMES="${PN} lib${PN}2"
    PKG_HINTS='setup runtime'
    PKG_CONTENTS[0]='--exclude=usr/bin/*.dll usr/'
    PKG_CONTENTS[1]='usr/bin/*.dll'

PKG_NAMES is a string list of package names; the first package name must 
be ${PN}.

PKG_HINTS is a string list of setup.hint names; the .hint extension is
optional here (but mandatory for the files themselves).  These will be
installed as setup.hint in the corresponding directory of dist/${PN}/.
PKG_HINTS will default to PKG_NAMES if left undefined.

PKG_CONTENTS[] is an array; each element (starting with 0) should be
defined as the files to include in the corresponding binary package as
arguments to tar(1).  Alternatively, a PKG_NAME.list file can be created 
in CYGWIN-PATCHES with the argument list, in which case the PKG_CONTENTS 
member should not be defined.

cygport will check that all PKG_* variables refer to the same number of
packages.

During the 'package' phase, the additional packages will be created as
subdirectories of dist/${PN}/ for easy transfer to release/, e.g.:

    libgnome2/libgnome2-devel/libgnome2-devel-2.14.0-1.tar.bz2
    libgnome2/libgnome2-devel/setup.hint    # ${C}/devel.hint
    libgnome2/libgnome2-doc/libgnome2-doc-2.14.0-1.tar.bz2
    libgnome2/libgnome2-doc/setup.hint        # ${C}/doc.hint
    libgnome2/libgnome2-2.14.0-1-src.tar.bz2
    libgnome2/libgnome2-2.14.0-1.tar.bz2
    libgnome2/setup.hint                    # ${C}/setup.hint
