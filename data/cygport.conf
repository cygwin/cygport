#****** Configuration/cygport.conf
#  DESCRIPTION
#  The cygport.conf file can be used by users to customize certain aspects
#  of cygport's behaviour.  Users who wish to customize their settings should
#  copy the default /etc/cygport.conf file to $HOME/.cygport.conf and edit the
#  latter.
#****

#****v* Configuration/DISTDIR
#  DESCRIPTION
#  A directory where downloaded sources should be saved, saving time and
#  bandwidth (at the expense of storage space) should the same sources be
#  needed again (e.g. by another release of the same version, or builds of
#  the same package for different toolchains).
#****
#DISTDIR=$HOME/Downloads

#****v* Configuration/MAKEOPTS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to cygmake.  The primary purpose of MAKEOPTS is to control
#  parallel make.  Some packages may not build correctly with parallel make
#  due to broken Makefile rules; such packages, if not easily patched, can
#  append "-j1" to MAKEOPTS or cygmake to force serial make for that package.
#  DEFAULT VALUE
#  -j [nprocs + 1]
#****
#MAKEOPTS=-j3


#****v* Configuration/SSH_KEY
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Path to the SSH private key corresponding to the public key registered
#  for uploading on sourceware. You'll need to set this if your private key
#  isn't already loaded into a running ssh-agent(1), and it doesn't have one
#  of the expected file names such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa. Also, setting this
#  allows cygport to determine if a passphrase is needed to decrypt the key,
#  and only prompt you for a passphrase if it's needed. Otherwise, you'll
#  be prompted for a passphrase every time you upload.
#****
#SSH_KEY=


#****v* Configuration/SIG
#  DESCRIPTION
#  If defined to a boolean true value, activates GPG signing of .cygport files
#  and patches, providing that the gnupg package is installed.
#  NOTE
#  This is a user-specific setting and must NOT be set or used in .cygport files.
#****
#SIG=1


#****v* Configuration/BROWSER
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Preferred web browser to be used by cygport's homepage command.  If
#  undefined, 'xdg-open' will be used if present, otherwise 'cygstart' will
#  be used to launch Windows' default browser.
#  NOTE
#  If BROWSER is exported in your user environment, it need not be set here.
#****
#BROWSER=


#****v* Configuration/EDITOR
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Preferred text editor to be used by cygport's announce command.  If
#  undefined, 'vi' will be used.
#  NOTE
#  If EDITOR is exported in your user environment, it need not be set here.
#****
#EDITOR=


#****v* Configuration/PAGER
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Preferred pager to be used by cygport's info, list, listdebug, and depends
#  commands.  If undefined, 'less' will be used if present.
#  NOTE
#  If PAGER is exported in your user environment, it need not be set here.
#****
#PAGER=


#****v* Configuration/SMTP_SENDER
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Name and email address, in the form of "First Last <user@domain>" to be used
#  by cygport's announcement command.
#  NOTE
#  Many webmail services do not allow using arbitrary sender address in SMTP
#  mail, or may first require registering other email addresses as authorized
#  senders.
#****
#SMTP_SENDER=

#****v* Configuration/SMTP_SERVER
#  DESCRIPTION
#  The SMTP server to be used by cygport's announce command.  If unset,
#  'localhost' will be used by default.
#****
#SMTP_SERVER=

#****v* Configuration/SMTP_SERVER_PORT
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Port number for SMTP_SERVER.  If undefined, port 465 will be used if
#  SMTP_ENCRYPTION is 'ssl', otherwise port 25 will be used by default.
#****
#SMTP_SERVER_PORT=

#****v* Configuration/SMTP_ENCRYPTION
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Encryption method for connection to SMTP_SERVER.  Valid values are 'ssl'
#  for SMTPS and 'tls' for SMTP+STARTTLS.  If undefined, no encryption will
#  be used (not recommended).
#  NOTE
#  If set to 'ssl', SMTP_SERVER_PORT will default to port 465.
#****
#SMTP_ENCRYPTION=

#****v* Configuration/SMTP_USER
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Username for authenticating with SMTP_SERVER, if required.
#****
#SMTP_USER=

#****v* Configuration/SMTP_PASS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Password for authenticating with SMTP_SERVER, if required.
#  WARNING
#  If defined, be sure that this file has 0600 permissions so that other
#  users may not read your password.
