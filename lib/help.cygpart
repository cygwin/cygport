		cygport is a utility for creating and building Cygwin software packages.

		Usage: cygport [OPTIONS] CYGPORT_FILE COMMAND [COMMAND2 ...]

		OPTIONS may include the following:

		  --32, -4     build package for i686 Cygwin
		  --64, -8     build package for x86_64 Cygwin
		  --debug      enable debugging messages

		The --32 and --64 options are mutually exclusive.

		On Cygwin, if neither the --32 nor --64 options are enabled,
		the package will be built for the architecture on which cygport
		is run.  On other systems, one of those options is required.

		  download      download upstream sources from Internet
		  prep          create working directory, unpack sources and apply patches
		  compile       run all compilation steps
		  test          run the package's test suite, if one exists
		  install       install into a DESTDIR, and run post-installation steps
		  package       create binary and source packages
		  package-test  create binary and source packages, marked as test
		  upload        upload finished packages to cygwin.com
		  announce      send an announcement email to cygwin.com
		  finish        delete the working directory
		  all           run prep, compile, install and package
