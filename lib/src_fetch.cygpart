#****** Chapter 5/Downloading
#****

#****v* Downloading/SRC_URI
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Download address(es) for the package source file(s), as a string.
#  The first file in SRC_URI will be considered the primary source file
#  and will determine the default SRC_DIR.
#
#  Individual source files maintained locally may also be used by adding
#  their basenames to SRC_URI.
#
#  The basename of each URI is treated as the source filename, except that
#  CGI query strings are dropped after downloading.  If this would not yield
#  a usable filename, then the file can be renamed by appending an artificial
#  URI fragment in the form of #/FILENAME to the URI.  Some examples where this
#  may be useful or even necessary:
#  * an unversioned source tarball
#  * a file, patch, or snapshot from a gitweb interface (where all specific
#    information is in the query string itself)
#  * a patch from a cgit interface (normally /patch?id=COMMIT)
#  * a file from a Bugzilla attachment (normally /attachment.cgi?id=NUMBER)
#
#  This variable is required, but many cygclasses automatically define
#  a default SRC_URI based on the values of PN and PV.

#****v* Downloading/PATCH_URI
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Download address(es) for source patches which are to be applied immediately
#  after unpacking sources, as a string.
#
#  Individual source patches maintained locally may also be used by adding
#  their basenames to PATCH_URI.  This provides an easy way to carry
#  Cygwin-specific patches forward between releases.
#
#  Compressed patches and patch archives will be uncompressed on-the-fly.
#  Supported compression formats are gzip, bzip2, xz and zstd.
#
#  NOTE
#
#  For historical reasons, patches with basenames of ${PF}.{cygwin,src}.patch
#  should not be listed in PATCH_URI, as they are treated specially and are
#  automatically applied, if present, and generated, if required.
#
#  NOTE
#
#  See SRC_URI for details about URI handling in cygport.
